[filament_motion_sensor encoder_sensor]
detection_length: 7.0
# The minimum length of filament pulled through the sensor to trigger
# a state change on the switch_pin
# Default is 7 mm.

extruder:extruder
# The name of the extruder section this sensor is associated with.
# This parameter must be provided.

switch_pin: ^filament_monitor_sensor_pin

pause_on_runout: True
# When set to True, a PAUSE will execute immediately after a runout
# is detected. Note that if pause_on_runout is False and the
# runout_gcode is omitted then runout detection is disabled. Default
# is True.

runout_gcode:
  PAUSE
  M117 [ERROR] Runout Detected!
	RESPOND MSG="[ERROR] Runout Detected!"
  #M600
  #FILAMENT_RUNOUT
# A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament runout is
# detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. If
# pause_on_runout is set to True this G-Code will run after the
# PAUSE is complete. The default is not to run any G-Code commands.

insert_gcode:
  M117 Filament encoder inserted
	RESPOND MSG="Filament encoder inserted"
  #LOAD_FILAMENT
# A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament insert is
# detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The
# default is not to run any G-Code commands, which disables insert
# detection.

event_delay: 3.0
# The minimum amount of time in seconds to delay between events.
# Events triggered during this time period will be silently
# ignored. The default is 3 seconds.

pause_delay: 5.0
# The amount of time to delay, in seconds, between the pause command
# dispatch and execution of the runout_gcode. It may be useful to
# increase this delay if OctoPrint exhibits strange pause behavior.
# Default is 0.5 seconds.

# See the "filament_switch_sensor" section for a description of the
# above parameters.

# This will disable the SFS 1 second after klipper starts
